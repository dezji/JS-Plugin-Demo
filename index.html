                            jQuery can enhance validation for an online form by simplifying the steps it would 
                            take to do so as opposed to just regular JavaScript. For example, having the script ready as 
                            soon as the DOM has loaded in. Accessing multiple fields in one line of code than having to call 
                            each field one by one like in JS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first website that I found that demonstrates form validation is 
                            <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/signup">Spotify</a>'s <b>sign up form</b> (see image gallery for example).<br>
                            This form will show an error message when the input field loses focus without anything being entered.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second website that demonstrates form validation is
                            <a href="https://signin.ea.com/p/originX/create?execution=e488335658s1&initref=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.ea.com%3A443%2Fconnect%2Fauth%3Fdisplay%3DoriginXWeb%252Fcreate%26response_type%3Dcode%26release_type%3Dprod%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.origin.com%252Fviews%252Flogin.html%26locale%3Den_US%26client_id%3DORIGIN_SPA_ID#">
                                Origin</a>'s <b>create an account form</b> (see image gallery for example).<br>
                            This form shows an error when the field isn't correctly formed. It also has a reminder for the password field 
                            that shows the requirements for a password.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            For the four methods / selectors I find most important when creating an online form with jQuery validation, I believe
                            the :input selector, :text, val/val(value) methods and the trim() method should be at the top of the list.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The :input selector can gather any fields in a form that have an input element. That's pretty useful for accessing controls and validating input 
                            from the end users.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The :text selector is just like the input selector except it is specific to text based input types. This is good for grabbing all of the text 
                            in a form without having to go through the input selector.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The val/val(value) methods are really good at grabbing a value at whatever element is selected and can change the selected elements value at any 
                            time. I find that pretty cool and time-effiecient.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trim() method is by far, the best method to use in jQuery. It trims off all whitespaces that aren't need in an input, which can save a lot 
                            of lines of code and makes the validation process even easier.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The difference between a jQuery plugin and a jQuery UI widget is the amount of code it takes to utilize the tool. jQuery UI is 
                            basically a user interface where as the plugin is what it sounds like, a plug into a feature.
                            The ways in which the two are similar is that they both have to be linked to your website in some way to function properly.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            A bxSlider seems to me (as a user) like a really expansive slideshow. It holds a lot of potential to be super helpful 
                            and user-friendly.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Plugins can be found through various websites:<br>
                            <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com">the jQuery Plugin Registry</a>,<br>
                            <a href="http://jquery-plugins.net">jQuery Plugins</a>,<br>
                            <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a><br>
                            and many more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To use a plugin, you must first look at the documentation of the plugin to see what code is required to use the plugin 
                            successfully. Then you can either download the plugin and save it to your website or get the URL for the plugin's CDN.
                            After downloading or getting the URL for the CDN, script in the plugin or link the download.
                            After these steps have been done, it's simply a plug and play from that point on.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The files and folders that jQuery UI requires to operate correctly includes:<br>
                            the jQuery library in an external folder, the index file that demos the features, the uncomped versions of the CSS 
                            and jQuery files, and the CSS files of the structure and theme (which can be optional);<br>
                            Widgets only need the jQuery UI CSS file, the jQuery UI library file, and an images folder that contains the images needed.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This files and folders can be included by using the link and script elements in an HTML doc. The link element would 
                            link the min CSS file. And the script element would link the CDN URL. A second script would link to the min jQuery UI file and the 
                            third script element would link to the JS file if it isn't coded in the last (third) script.
